            <p class="content-1">The department, year after year, welcomes some of the best and brightest minds of the country and provides them a platform to showcase their talents, ideas and skills before the world. And before making
                                    this aim a reality, we have a beautiful tradition of making the first years feel loved and wanted. Organized on September 25th, the official freshers’ party marked a new chapter of memories for all of us. As always, the event began with lighting a lamp and cutting a cake, followed by a
                                    welcome speech by Dr. Preeti Dharmarha. Moving forward with certain entertaining tasks and performances to promote a more friendly interaction between the seniors and the freshers, the event was equally enjoyed by one and all. Much to attendees’ pleasant surprise, the first years also participated with equal fervor and enthusiasm in all the activities, tasks and performances.

                                 This year to thank our seniors for helping and guiding us and to make them feel special and make their last memories of the college memorable PI: The Department of Mathematics organized an online farewell.
                                 With the efforts of the first and second year students, the dept. was able to give the seniors a very interactive and memorable farewell. The farewell consisted of multiple activities and surprises from making an Instagram account to providing each and every senior with a loving paragraph explaining their college journeys. The event also consisted of making an Instagram filter for the farewell as well as a Q&A session with the seniors. Lastly, we made a farewell video to give the seniors a glimpse of the past three years in 2 minutes.
                                 Farewell are supposed to one of the most important moments of one’s college life. Even though we were not able to celebrate it offline, the juniors made sure that each and every senior left the college with a smile and loving memories.

            <img src="images/Teachers123.png" alt="main-photo">
            <p class="content-1">Who says heroes are found flying against gravity towards the sky, dressed in flowing capes and mysterious masks? Heroes of this world are found in classrooms. Yes, they are none other than our teachers.
                This year, students of PI: The Department of Mathematics organized an online Teachers' Day program to thank some of the most important people of our lives, the ones who impart knowledge and instruct us. Teachers are the doctors without stethoscope that every child in our country must have access to, to be able to cross his/her set of crevasses and walls.
                Second and third-year students participated in this event very heartily to honour our hardworking and loving teachers. The program commenced by welcoming all the teachers, followed by listening to the teachers' experience of their teaching life which was the cherry on the cake. The students planned a very amazing event, outstanding dance performances, melodious songs, musical instruments, funny and emotional poems to thank our teachers. Our teachers enjoyed this program very much and appreciated us for our efforts to make this online Teachers' Day memorable for them.
                At last, we all thanked our teachers from the bottom of our hearts for their selfless passion and hard work towards educating the future of this nation.

            <h2 id="teacher-20">General Mathematics Quiz</h2>
            <img src="images/Teachers123.png" alt="main-photo">
            <p class="content-1">Not everything can be learnt from lectures, workshops and interactive sessions. At
                times what we, as students, learn more from are examinations and competitions, which not only test, but
                also strengthen our conceptual knowledge. Acknowledging this
                fact, the department organized a quiz competition for the students, right after Dr. Ghosh’s lecture. The
                highlight of the event was that, despite being a mathematics-intensive round, the event
                was still open to students from all fields of study. The quiz invited participants from all colleges and
                all years alike. It was an absolute delight for the department to welcome student participants
                from a large number of colleges. The freshmen, sophomores and the final years participated with
                equal enthusiasm and determination. The competition was conducted in two rounds. The first
                one being an objective MCQ round, and was conducted by Mr. Ekansh Jauhari, former President, Department
                of Mathematics, whereas as the second round was hosted by the famous
                quiz master, Mr. Duttnath Thakur and Mr. Parth Chawla, Ex-Vice President of the department.
                The winners of the event were Mr. Chaintanya and team from St. Stephen’s College, DU, who
                won prize vouchers and a cash reward of Rs. 1200. The first runner up was the team headed by
                Mr. Rupak Jain, again from St. Stephen’s College, winning prize vouchers and a prize money of
                Rs. 800, whereas the second runner ups were Mr. Shubham Kumar Yadav and Mr. Deepak from
                Hansraj College, with prize vouchers and a cash reward of Rs. 500. The quiz competition turned
                out to be highly knowledge-imparting.
