            <p class="content-1">AYUSH TYAGI 
                13 October 2021
                
                John Von Neumann, the significant contributor of the minimax theorem of 1928, duly said, “If people do not believe that Mathematics is simple, it’s only because they do not realise how complicated life is.” 
                An example of such sophisticated mathematics and one of the most sought-after exams is believed to be IIT-JAM. It is a national-level examination conducted to shortlist students for admission into Master of Science and Integrated Master of Science courses and is jointly conducted by the IITs and the Indian Institute of Science (IISC). 
                This term’s first episode of Lakshya: The Career Talks 2021-22 was titled Unwinding the correct approach to IIT-JAM with Ayush Tyagi. 
                Ayush Tyagi, our alumnus, has proven that nothing is impossible if you put in sincere hard work and commitment. He is an inspiration to all those who come after him and wish to follow in his footsteps. Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mathematics and Computing at IIT Guwahati, the speaker talked about his academic and holistic journey at Hansraj and also shared insights about his experiences at the illustrated Guwahati campus. Far and wide, high and low, it was reputed as one of the most informative sessions that helped attendees solve their queries about IIT-JAM. He also discussed the differences between various Master's degrees in the field of mathematics and his course and how he ended up choosing his respective one rather than any other program in any other college. The AIR 51 achiever shared his strategy and the study plan to crack the exam and highly stressed upon the value of consistency for around 105 attendees. By the end of it, everyone seemed to have clarity of thought and was motivated to do something extraordinary and we call that a success.

                1 November 2021
                
                The second episode, “Mathemagic: Acing UPSC CSE with Maths Optional” of Lakshya: The Career Talks 2021-22, was successfully organized with Mr.Utkarsh Kumar, AIR 55 (highest scorer in Maths Optional), UPSC CSE 2020, AIR-5 holder in JEE Advanced 2013 and an IIT-Bombay Alumnus. The session not only illuminated the beauty of mathematics but also enlightened the real-life challenges faced by aspirants. Our speaker, Mr. Utkarsh Kumar shared insights of his preparation with the audience. According to him, mathematics is a scoring optional, provided the candidate works hard. His marks (356/500) speak for themselves and are testimonials of the same. He also highlighted the importance of time management and trying to solve the problem without directly jumping to the solution. He also mentioned how his involvement in co-curricular activities and sports helped him in enhancing his personality which is essential in the long run. According to him, short breaks and refreshments while studying enhance one's efficiency and productivity. When done with the substantial level of preparation, he suggested everyone to practice as many papers and mocks as possible, as it not only helps in assessing yourself but also increases speed which is vital, when writing an exam as huge as UPSC. The session was followed by a query session where he resolved all the doubts related to this prestigious examination. Felicitated by one-too-many great responses, the session proved to be of massive help to the aspirants and it came to an end with appealing motivational words from our speaker and added up to the mathematical relevance of the Lakshya Series of the department.
                
                
                Capt. Dr. Sunaina Singh
                6th February 2022
                Career in Indian Army: A Primer
                
                The Department of Mathematics, Hansraj College, successfully conducted the third episode of "Lakshya: The Career Talks" with Captain (Dr.) Sunaina Singh on 6th February 2022. She is an ex-army officer, ex-University of Delhi professor, motivational speaker, and national-level handball player with a doctorate in psychology and MBA in HR. It was an interactive session where Sunaina ma'am cleared the doubts of our audience on the topic with really comprehensive and detailed answers.
                The session commenced with diving into Dr. Sunaina's personal life experiences and she told us what initially motivated her was the ideology of living for others and quoted, "Apne liye toh sabhi jeete hain, insaan wahi hai jo desh ke liye kuch kare, dusron ke liye kuch kare". She also explained how success can have distinct significance for everyone and it is a journey to be celebrated. She then told students to decide what success means to them and stated “When the why is clear, life’s purpose is clear”.  Further, our audience asked various questions concerning joining the army, such as the perfect time to join the army, and the different channels through which one can join it. While answering those questions, ma'am provided a deep insight into how the interviews are conducted, giving students an in-depth understanding of how the psychological aspects are reflected in the interview, which is unknown to most of the candidates applying for the same.
                She put forward five crucial points which are selflessness, adaptability, integrity, communication skills, and attitude along with mental stamina to be very important for everyone in life, especially those wanting to have a career in the Indian Army. “Always work on your basics”, “Hard work always pays off”, and “Just keep moving” were a few of the many powerful and inspiring statements quoted by her. Her ultimate message to the students was to always believe in themselves, be real, and be a keen learner. Lastly, she told everyone to realize that “Log different hote hai, sahi ya galat nahi” and things will become easier for them.
                The energy of the whole session was unmatched by the participation and enthusiasm displayed by the audience in the session. Overall, it was a brainstorming and inspiring session.
