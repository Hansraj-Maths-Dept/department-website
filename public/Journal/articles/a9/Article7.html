    <h1>Pigeonhole Principle</h1>
    <h6>Ashutosh Maurya<br />B.Sc. (H) Mathematics, 2nd Year</h6>
    <p>When an intrinsically trivial and intuitive statement has deep implications and consequences, it is
        naturally intriguing for people, mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike. One such statement
        is that of the Pigeonhole principle. This article shall discuss the various nuances of this principle,
        highlighting the dependence of mathematics on basic thoughts and pure logic.</p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>We begin, as the introduction to a mathematical concept should, with the statement and proof of the
        Pigeonhole principle.</p>
    <p class="cen"><i>The pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least
        one container must contain more than one item.</i></p>
    <p>The principle is believed to be formalized by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. Since he published his
        works in both French and German, he used the terms Schubfach in German and tiroir in French to
        describe what in English may refer to as a drawer. These terms were morphed to the word pigeonhole,
        which is one of the reasons of the intrigue associated with this principle.</p>
    <p>Although the statement seems intuitive and obvious, we shall give a formal proof. We shall use
        one of the most potent tools to establish proofs in mathematics: proving by contradiction.</p>
    <p>Let us assume that no container contains more than one item. So, each of the m containers will
        either have 0 or 1 item. If the number of containers with 0 items is k, then certainly, k  0. So, the
        number of containers with 1 item will be m−k. So, the number of items in k containers will be m−k.
        But k−m < k < n, and n items had been put in k containers. Therefore, we arrive at a contradiction,
        which arose due to the wrong assumption. Hence, at least one container must contain more than one
        item.</p>
    <p>Apart from the statement mentioned above, there are several versions of the Pigeonhole principle,
        some of which are worth mentioning here. A simple generalization of the principle exists, which deals
        with multiple “pigeons”. It says:</p>
    <p class="cen"><i>Let n, m and r be positive integers so that n > rm. If n items are put into m containers. then at
        least one container must contain more than r items.</i></p>
    <p>This generalization can be proved in a similar fashion to establish its verity. It is sometimes called
        the Second Pigeonhole Principle, while the first statement is called the First Pigeonhole Principle.</p>
    <p>Another version was given by Edsger W. Dijkstra, the pioneering computing scientist. According
        to him, the usual statements of the principle “contain a lot of misleading noise, are overspecific, and
        hide the principle’s arithmetic nature”. He composed a formulation free of metaphors and “misleading
        visualizations”. It says:</p>
    <p class="cen"><i>For a nonempty, finite bag of real numbers, the maximum is at least the average (and the minimum is
        at most the average)</i></p>
    <p>Though this “stronger” form may lead to easier interpretation and solving of certain problems,
        sometimes, it may complicate them too. While the traditional statement forces us to explicitly identify
        “pigeons” and “holes”, or items and compartments, this form may need the same process, in addition
        to worrying about the numbers and the average.</p>
    <h3>Popular Examples and Applications</h3>
    <p>The simplicity of the Pigeonhole principle does not understate its importance. From numerical analysis
        to computer sciences, the principle finds its applications in multiple, seemingly unrelated fields.</p>
    <p>A particularly famous example is the Birthday Paradox. It is not a paradox per se, but it is called
        so because it is unbelievably counterintuitive.</p>
    <p class="cen"><i>The birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen
        people, some pair of them will have the same birthday.</i></p>
    <p>Since there are 365 days in one year (366 in a leap year), with a group of just 367 randomly chosen
        people, the probability reaches 100%. This is a simple application of the Pigeonhole principle, since
        the number of people is greater than the number of days, more than one person will be associated with
        a particular date. Moreover, using probability, it can also be shown that even with just 70 people,
        99.9% probability is reached, and with just 23 people, 50% is reached.</p>
    <p>Another important application of the pigeonhole principle is found in the proof of Dirichlet’s Approximation
        Theorem. In number theory, Dirichlet’s theorem on Diophantine approximation, also
        called Dirichlet’s approximation theorem, states that for any real numbers  and N, with 1  N,
        there exist integers p and q such that 1  q  N and</p>
    <p>SOME EQUATIONS/p>
    <p>The theorem provides a way to find “good” approximations of irrational numbers, using a fraction
        with a relatively small denominator. It should be pointed out that by using fractions with large
        denominators, the process of approximation becomes clumsy and unreliable. The theorem can be
        proved using the pigeonhole principle.</p>
    <p>Consider the set A = {j | 0  j  N}. So |A| = N + 1. Now, we take partitions of the set [0, 1)
        such as
        
        0, 1
        N
        
        ,
         1
        N , 2
        N
        
        , and so on. There will be N such partitions.
        Since there are N + 1 numbers and N partitions, by the Pigeonhole principle, there must be at least
        two numbers that belong to the same partition. Let these numbers be r and s, and without loss of
        generality, let r < s.</p>
    <p>Now, there must be an integer p such that 0  r − s  1
        N , since the partitions are defined so. Let
        q = r − s. So, we have</p>
    <p>Some EAUATIONS</p>
    <p>Subtracting p and dividing by q, we get</p>
    <p>SOME EQUATIONS</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>SOME EQUATIONS</p>
    <p>which is the desired result.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem states that every irrational algebraic number  has approximation
        exponent equal to 2. The approximation exponent is the measure of “closely” it can be
        approximated by rationals. This guarantees that results like the following inequality are not possible:
    </p>
    <p>Some EQUATIONS</p>
    <p>Klaus Friedrich Roth won the Fields Medal for proving this theorem.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The Pigeonhole Principle doesn’t seem to be any more than just a “truth” about counting, yet many
        advanced theorems have been borne out of it. It continues to have real life applications in various
        aspects, and its thorough understanding yields greater mastery as well as appreciation towards mathematics
        in general.</p>
