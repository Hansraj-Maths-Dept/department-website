    <h1>Set Theory versus Continuum<br />Hypothesis</h1>
    <h6 align="center">Dr. Preeti Dharmarha<br />Associate Professor</h6>
    <p>Since ancient times, the role of Mathematics for rational enquiry of the truth in the foundation
        of all scientific thoughts has always been acknowledged. Dawn of \({19}^{th}\) century was marked by the
        beginning of systematic search for the foundations of Mathematics and after going through a series
        of difficulties in the early \({20}^{th}\) century, the mathematical discoveries started stabilizing resulting in a
        large, intelligible body of mathematical knowledge which is still providing impetus to active research
        fields.</p>
    <p>The wheel in the late nineteenth century turned in a new direction when a mathematical theory
        of sets was crafted and advanced by the renowned mathematician, Georg Cantor (1845-1918). The
        seed of this theory was sown when Cantor proved a key theorem in real analysis, through which a
        method for creating real number sets that elaborated on a countless iteration of the limit operation,
        was introduced. The novelty of this proof steered him into an insight of sets of real numbers and
        to the abstraction of his set theory. The conception of ideas given by Cantor has now permeated
        mathematics, offering an adaptable means for exploring even deeper concepts of infinity and sets of
        infinite measure.</p>
    <p>The credit for investigating the following question goes to Cantor:</p>
    <p class="cen"><i>Can the concept of “size” be extended to infinite sets?</i></p>
    <p>The uncountability of the set of real numbers led Cantor to establish the following result: the existence
        of “infinitely many different infinites”, which had an obvious mathematical and philosophical
        implication.</p>
    <p>In 1874, Cantor established that the set of natural numbers and the set of algebraic numbers were in
        one-to-one correspondence. At the same time, he established that no such one-to-one correspondence
        existed between sets of natural and real numbers. Cantor tried to explore the possibility of the existence
        of any infinite sets of real numbers that corresponded in one-to-one manner with the set of natural
        numbers, but not with the real numbers set. In 1878, the Continuum Hypothesis was proclaimed by
        Cantor after introducing uncountable sets, which stated that: <b>“every infinite set of real numbers
        matched in size with either the set of natural numbers or the entire set of real numbers
            and no set of intermediate size existed”</b>. Since this result led to the conclusion that there were
        more than one level of infinity, it faced opposition by many mathematicians of that time. Some denied
        its existence based on their understanding that infinity was a non-legitimate mathematical abstraction.
        On the other hand, Christian theologians held the view that his work was contrary to the uniqueness
        of the absolute infinity in the nature of God.</p>
    <p>Throughout most of his career, Cantor grappled, without any success, to find a resolution to the
        Continuum Hypothesis. However, the problem continued to remain as one of the most prominent and
        baffling problems of the 20th century. In 1940, mathematician Kurt Gödel showed that it couldn’t
        be disproved within the usual axioms of set theory. In the 1960s, mathematician Paul Cohen showed
        that the continuum hypothesis can’t be proved by set theory. This won Cohen the Fields Medal, the
        highest honor in mathematics.</p>
    <p>Eventually, Cantor’s contribution to mathematical investigations was acknowledged. David Hilbert,
        a prominent mathematician of the 20th century, described Cantor’s work as “the finest creation of
        mathematical genius and one of the unbeatable achievements of purely scholarly human activity”.</p>
    <p>Hilbert, who had expertise in posing mathematical questions, published 23 open questions in the
        year 1900. Many have been solved but some still remain unanswered. But all endeavors to seek a
        solution to these problems have resulted in some very deep mathematics. Riemann hypothesis is one
        such example. The act lies in asking a good question.</p>
    <p>In 1946, he presented 10 of these 23 problems at the first major international gathering of mathematics
        after the World War II, ‘The Princeton University Bicentennial Conference on Problems of
        Mathematics’. The problem which topped the list still remains unreturned, and it is the famous
        ‘Continuum Hypothesis’.</p>
    <p>After Cantor’s demise, most of the researchers in the field of set theory declared that the Continuum
        Hypothesis was unresolvable. From Cantor until 1940, Continuum remained the focus of the
        advancement in Set Theory. Although both, the set of natural numbers and that of real numbers, are
        infinite, there are more real numbers than the natural numbers; this commenced the journey to the
        exploration of different sizes of infinity. However, Cantor’s ideas gained momentum and set theory
        gained significance in the unearthing and creation of new mathematical results, especially in fields like
        the theory of functions and measure theory. The efficacy of this tool regarding traditional mathematics
        was realized by the mathematical community and received acceptance due to corresponding change in
        the attitudes. The theory of abstract sets propounded by Cantor would revolutionize the mathematical
        progress in due course.</p>
    <p>There are two general approaches to set theory “<b>Naïve set theory</b>” credited to Cantor and
        “<b>Axiomatic set theory</b>” which is due to Zermelo-Fraenkel (<b>ZFC</b>). The most important difference
        in the two approaches is that the naive theory doesn’t have much by way of axioms.
        As stated by Cantor:</p>
    <p class="cen">“A set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our
        thought-which are called elements of the set.”</p>
    <p>Cantor did not define the concept of ‘set’ in his Naïve set theory. The nature of elements of the sets
        was generally ignored. While the set was considered as a collection of objects, it was also presumed
        that any object can be a member of a set. “Naïve set theory” in the sense of naïve theory is a nonformalized
        theory wherein sets and operations on sets are styled using natural language. The terms
        and, or, if . . . then, not, for some, for every, are the same as in ordinary mathematics.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Membership</b>: \(x\) belongs to a set \(A\), if \(x\) is a member of the set, and is denoted by \(x \in A\).</li>
        <li><b>Equality</b>: If every element of a set \(A\) is in a set \(B\) and every element of \(B\) is in \(A\), sets \(A\) and 
            \(B\) are defined to be equal.</li>
        <li><b>Empty set</b>: The empty set, often denoted \(\phi\) and sometimes \({}\), is a set with no members at
            all. Since the empty set has no members it is unique but it can be a member of other sets. This
            justifies \(\phi \neq {\phi} \), because the former has no members and the latter has one member.</li>
        <li><b>Specifying sets</b>: A set is defined extensionally by enclosing a list of its elements between curly
            braces and it is sufficient to describe the set.</li>
        <li><b>Subsets</b>: Given two sets \(A\) and \(B\), \(A\) is a subset of \(B\) if every element of \(A\) is also an element of
            \(B\). In particular, each set \(B\) is a subset of itself; a subset of \(B\) that is not equal to \(B\) is called a
            proper subset.
            If \(A\) is a subset of \(B\), then one can also say that \(B\) is a superset of \(A\), that \(A\) is contained in \(B\),
            or that ,\(B\) contains \(A\).</li>
        <li><b>Unions, Intersections, and Relative Complements</b>: Given two sets \(A\) and \(B\), the set
            consisting of all objects which are elements of \(A\) or of \(B\) or of both is their union, denoted by
            \(A \cup B\).<br />
            The set \(A \cap B\) of all elements which are both in \(A\) and in \(B\) is the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\).
            Finally, the set theoretic difference of \(A\) and \(B\) or the relative complement of \(B\) relative to \(A\), is
            the set of all objects that belong to \(A\) but not to \(B\). It is written as \(A\backslash B\) or \(A − B\).</li>
        <li><b>Ordered pairs and Cartesian products</b>: Intuitively, it is a collection of two objects where
            one can be distinguished as the first element and the other as the second element with the
            fundamental property that, two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their first elements are
            equal and their second elements are equal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Paradoxes are witnessed, without restriction, upon assuming that any property may be used to
        form a set, a common example being Russell’s paradox; there is no set consisting of “all sets that do
        not contain themselves”.</p>
    <p>More set theories emerged from the questions raised on the unambiguity and consistency of what
        exactly comprised and what did not comprise a set. One such widely accepted theory is Zermelo-
        Fraenkel set theory.</p>
    <p>An axiomatic structure was advocated by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel so as to frame a
        theory of sets restricting paradoxes such as Russell’s paradox in the early twentieth century.</p>
    <p>ZFC is the truncation of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the debatable axiom of choice counted
        in, where C denotes “choice”, and ZF stands for the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the
        axiom of choice omitted. Following axioms comprise ZFC set theory:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Axiom A1 (Axiom of extent)</b>: For the classes \(x\), \(A\) and \(B\), \([A = B]\) , \([x \in A \Leftrightarrow x \in B]\)</li>
        <li><b>Axiom A2 (Axiom of class construction)</b>: Let \(P(x)\) designate a statement about \(x\) which can
            be expressed entirely in terms of the symbols \(\in , \vee , \wedge, \neg , \rightarrow , \forall \) brackets and variables \(x, y, z, . . . , A,
            B, . . ..\) Then there exists a class \(C\) which consists of all the elements \(x\) which satisfy \(P(x)\).</li>
        <li><b>Axiom A3 (Axiom of pair)</b>: If \(A\) and \(B\) are sets, then the doubleton \({A,B}\) is a set.</li>
        <li><b>Axiom A4 (Axiom of subsets)</b>: If \(S\) is a set and \(\phi\) is a formula describing a particular
            property, then the class of all sets in \(S\) which satisfy this property \(\phi\) is a set. More succinctly,
            every subclass of a set of sets is a set.</li>
        <li><b>Axiom A5 (Axiom of power set)</b>: If \(A\) is a set, then the power set \(P(A)\) is a set.</li>
        <li><b>Axiom A6 (Axiom of union)</b>: For a set of sets \(A,{\bigcup}_{C|\in A} C\) is a set.</li>
        <li><b>Axiom A7 (Axiom of replacement)</b>: Let \(A\) be a set. Let \(\phi(x, y)\) be a formula which associates
            to each element \(x\) of \(A\) an element \(y\) in such a way that whenever both \(\phi(x, y)\) and \(\phi(x, z)\) hold
            true, \(y = z\). Then there exists a set \(B\) that contains all elements \(y\) such that \(\phi(x, y)\) holds true
            for some \(x\ \in \ A\).</li>
        <li><b>Axiom A8 (Axiom of infinity)</b>: There exists a non-empty class \(A\) called a set that satisfies
            the condition: \(X\ \in \ A \Rightarrow\ X\ \cup\ {X}\ \in \ A\). (A set satisfying this condition is called a successor set
            or an inductive set.)</li>
        <li><b>Axiom A9 (Axiom of regularity)</b>: Every non-empty set \(A\) contains an element \(x\) whose
            intersection with \(A\) is empty.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another “special” and initially controversial axiom ‘Axiom of choice’ is usually stated separately.</p>
    <p><b>Axiom of choice</b>: For every set \(A\) of non-empty sets there is a function \(f\), which associates to
        every set \(A\) in \(A\), an element \(a \in A\).</p>
    <p>Sets have abundant significance in mathematics. In modern formal treatments, sets are used to
        define almost all mathematical objects like numbers, functions, relations, etc. Naïve set theory is
        sufficient for many reasons, as well as serves as a starting point for more formal treatments. If a
        naïve set theory correctly identifies the sets permissible to be studied, it is not essentially inconsistent.</p>
    <p>Similarly, an axiomatic set theory is neither essentially stable nor essentially free of paradoxes as is
        evident from Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.</p>
    <p>The choice between an axiomatic approach and other approaches largely depends on convenience.
        As far as mathematics in everyday is concerned, informal use of axiomatic set theory may be the best
        choice. Depending on notation, this informal usage of axiomatic set theory can precisely have the form
        of naïve set theory, which is noticeably simpler to read, write and grasp.</p>
    <ol>
        P.R. Halmos lists these properties as axioms in his book “Naïve Set Theory” as follows:
        <li>Axiom of extension</li>
        <li>Axiom of specification</li>
        <li>Axiom of pairs</li>
        <li>Axiom of union</li>
        <li>Axiom of powers.
        <li>Axiom of infinity</li>
        <li>Axiom of choice</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The humble notion of a set is generally introduced casually and regarded as self-evident. Very
        deep and magnificent, yet fundamental and humble, the concepts of Set Theory pervade all branches
        of mathematics. Remarkably, all usual mathematical objects can be represented as sets. For example,
        within set theory, one can create the natural numbers as well as the real numbers. The formal
        language of pure set theory allows one to formalize all mathematical notions and arguments. All
        algebraic structures, functional spaces, vector spaces, and topological spaces can be regarded as sets
        in the universe of sets. Therefore, while mathematical theorems can be regarded as statements about
        sets, they can also be proven from ZFC, which, in turn, are the axioms of set theory. One can, hence,
        infer that mathematics is rooted in set theory.
    <p>Since all of conventional mathematics can be developed within set theory, one can view certain
        results in set theory as being part of Metamathematics, the specialized branch within mathematics,
        which encompasses available mathematical tools to explore the nature and potential of mathematics.</p>
    <p>Both aspects of set theory, namely, the mathematical science of the infinite, and the foundation of
        mathematics, are of philosophical importance.</p>
