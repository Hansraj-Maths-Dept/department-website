                <h1>Introduction to Cryptography</h1>
                <h6 class="author" style="line-height: 2.0;"><b>Author: &nbsp; </b> Shubham Kumar Yadav <br /> <b>B.Sc. (H) Mathematics</b></h6>
                <hr>


                <p>Cryptography is the technique of securing information and communications through the use of
                    codes so that only those people for whom the information is intended can understand it and process
                    it. Sounds too dull and cumbersome, doesn’t it? Well, in layman terms, it simply means the art of
                    restricting the access of our data to the attackers. The term data here refers to information, which
                    can be as small as the click of a mouse button to as important as the data residing with the FBI.
                    Technically speaking, the process of scrambling this data so that it is illegible to the attacker is
                    called
                    encryption, and the reverse process of recovering the original message from this scrambled text is
                    termed as decryption. These two processes form the backbone of what is known as the encryption
                    system.</p>
                <p>The next question is: to achieve a better encryption system, which one of the two processes should
                    be strengthened? Some might answer the former, while others might opt for the latter. Interestingly
                    enough, it is indeed a vague question and generally, the level of complexity of the encryption
                    scheme
                    is roughly of the same order as the decryption scheme, and one cannot upgrade the first much without
                    improving the second too. In simpler terms, it means that as the lock of a door gets upgraded (say,
                    for example, from a simple padlock to a sophisticated fingerprint scanner) the corresponding key
                    will
                    also get upgraded (from a simple padlock’s key to a complex fingerprint sensor).</p>
                <p>Historically, cryptography and encryption have been wrongly used interchangeably, and this can
                    even be found today. Psychologically, the people are not to blame here, because the term
                    cryptography
                    did not gain its actual meaning until the recent onset of computers, digital currency, improved
                    banking facilities, password management, etc. The next curious observation would be as to how the
                    improvement in the aforementioned fields has led to an increased emphasis being given in the field
                    of
                    cryptography.</p>
                <p>To answer this, we need to understand the four features which cryptography provides us withthe
                    information cannot be comprehended by anyone for whom it was unintended (confidentiality),
                    the information cannot be altered in storage or transit between sender and intended receiver without
                    the alteration being detected (integrity), the creator/sender of information cannot deny his or her
                    intention to send information at a later stage (non-repudiation) and the identities of the sender,
                    the
                    receiver and the destination/origin of the information is confirmed (authentication). These four are
                    the basic necessities when dealing with a computer network and hence call for improved and secure
                    cryptographic systems.</p>
                <h3>Applications</h3>
                <p>Today, cryptography finds its uses in an array of fields, and one can witness its applications round
                    the clock: from receiving a Good Morning message on WhatsApp to sending a mail via Gmail, from
                    making online purchases via debit/credit cards to watching Sacred Games on Netflix, everything is
                    protected against the use by non-authorised parties.</p>
                <p>The recent advancement in the arena of shopping has been the introduction of the online platforms,
                    thereby bringing in ease and comfort. However, these platforms rely heavily on cryptographic
                    standards
                    for their functioning, as integrity, non-repudiation and authentication are a must while placing an
                    order. So, the simple button of ‘Add to cart’, must have been a long and tiring challenge for the
                    cryptographers to assure that the aforementioned objectives are achieved. Surfing movies and TV
                    shows on Netflix and dish connections also involve cryptography.</p>
                <p>The subscription which is bought on these platforms authorises the customers to use them. The
                    scrambled data received from the satellites is unscrambled with the help of a unique number
                    associated
                    with the subscription which you buy. In the event of an unauthorised person trying to access the
                    signals
                    and lack of this unique number, the decryption will not occur in the manner it should have been and
                    hence binge-watching would only be a dream for such souls.</p>
                <p>Cryptography also comes into play while withdrawing money from an ATM, or sending emails that
                    might contain sensitive information which the user might not want to make available to everyone.
                    With the advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the data of the consumers has
                    started gaining importance and advertisement companies are willing to pay hefty amounts for the
                    same. Cryptographers play a crucial role to play here to prevent crimes such as data theft and data
                    selling. The most prominent examples in this aspect are the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal,
                    and the Aadhaar Data Breach wherein the entire data of an individual registered with the UIDAI’s
                    Aadhaar Card was being sold for less than a buck.</p>
                <p>Cryptography even helped during World War II, wherein the Germans inflicted terrible atrocities
                    upon the world. An English mathematician and computer scientist, Alan Turing, devised a machine
                    which, as per the Morten Tyldum directed movie ‘The Imitation Game’, starring Benedict Cumberbatch,
                    was termed as Christopher. Christopher was successfully deployed to crack Enigma, the secured
                    device used by the Nazis to communicate their plan of action in the war. Turing, along with his team
                    and the use of statistics, was not only able to turn the table in favour of the Allies but was also
                    successful in reducing the duration of the war by up to 2 years, thereby avoiding the loss of
                    millions
                    of dollars and billions of lives!</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>So, when you wake up tomorrow and open WhatsApp, pay a second or two, recognising the efforts and
                    the cryptography involved in making the transmission of that message possible. In a nutshell, unless
                    we pack together all the computers, mobile phones and all other digital devices and throw them in an
                    abyss (which is an improbability), we all will be having data and its security will undoubtedly call
                    for
                    cryptography and its unending applications.</p>
