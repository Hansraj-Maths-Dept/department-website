    <h1>The Bizarre 25-Card Trick</h1>
    <h6 class="cen">Aman Chaudhary<br />B.Sc. (H) Mathematics, 2nd Year</h6>
    <p>Magic, especially with cards, has been a source of interest for people of all ages since a long time.
        Mathematics, which seems monotonous from a superficial view, has given rise to countless fantastic
        tools. One such amazing trick, dealing with 25 cards, shows how many lighthearted applications have
        deeply rooted mathematical concepts.</p>
    <p>Aim: You are going to ask your friend to pick a number from 1 to 25 and also any card from
            the shown 25 cards. By performing the steps below, you will be able to “magically” make the chosen
            card appear at the very chosen number.</p>
    <p>The trick is performed by the steps given below. Consider your friend’s name to be Ram. Also
            consider side A of a card to be the “face”, or the side denoting the suit and number of the card, and
            side B to be the “back”, or the side which is blank.
        <ol>
            <li>Take out 25 cards randomly from a usual deck of 52 cards to play the trick with.</li>
            <li>Showing the deck to Ram, ask him to pick any card from the 25-card deck. Also, ask him to
                choose any number between 1 and 25 and let you know his choice.</li>
            <li>Now consider, he chooses 12 as his number and Ace of Spades (present in those 25 cards) as his
                card.</li>
            <li>Hold the deck such that side A faces downward in your palm. Now distribute the 25 cards one
                by one such that side A faces upward while the cards are laid out into 5 piles having 5 cards
                each (Fig. 1 illustrates that the cards are distributed in such a way that the \({1}^{st}\) card lies in 1st
                pile, \({2}^{nd}\) card in \({2}^{nd}\) pile and so on until the \({5}^{th}\) card, and then the \({6}^{th} card in the \({1}^{st}\) pile and
                the \({7}^{th}\) card in the \({2}^{nd}\) pile again and so on).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, you unfold the cards, Ram will notice his card going in any of the 5 piles. Since
                the required card is unknown to you, ask Ram to tell which pile contained his required card.
                Consider he replies “the first pile”.</li>
            <li>Then, collect all the cards pile wise (side A facing upwards) without disturbing their positions
                and place the \({1}^{st}\) pile (containing the required card) at the second position i.e. at position B
                (as shown in Fig. 1). While placing them back in the palm for the next distribution, rotate the
                cards upside down such that side A faces downward, and distribute the cards again likewise as
                done in Step 4. Note that while placing the piles back into the palm, no internal position of
                cards of any pile is disturbed.</li>
            <li>Again, ask for the pile of 5 cards containing the required card. Suppose he says the \({1}^{st}\) pile again.
                Gather the cards again (as done in the last step), but this time placing the required pile as the
                \({3}^{rd}\) position from the top of your palm (side A facing up).</li>
            <li>Start unrolling the cards one by one and here it is, the selected card. The Ace of Spades comes
                up on the \({12}^{th}\) position at chosen in the deck of 25 cards.</li>
          
        </ol>
        Now let us discuss the underlying procedure and start unwrapping the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>Consider that the 25 cards are laid down such that side A faces up in five decks of five each as
        shown in the Figure 1 with A, B, C, D, E denoting each pile of 5 cards. This shows how those 25 cards
        have been distributed and since all this is random, any card of any suit and number may be present
        at any place. The reader might wonder at once why the cards numbered 0 to 24 and not 1 to 25. It is
        at this point that we demystify the trick.
        <ol>
            <li>Subtract 1 from the number Ram has chosen then express the resultant in the \(base\ 5\) notation.
                So, if number is \(k\), write \(k − 1\) in the form \(k − 1\ =\ a + 5b\) with each of \(0 \leq a\), \(b \leq 4\). The values
                of \((a, b)\) pairs are shown in subscript of each number in the table.</li>
                <li>We then picked up the cards pile wise and positioned them such that side A faces up in your
                    palm. But here lies the real trick in placing the piles in their appropriate position. Consider
                    numbering up the decks as \(0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3\) and \(4\), such that \(0\) lies on the top of your palm and then
                    followed below by \(1,\ 2,\ 3\) and then the pile numbered \(4\) at the bottom. Since \(k−1\) was represented
                    as \(k−1\ =\ a+5b\), so the very first time we pick the piles, the pile that contains Ram’s card should
                    be placed at the \({a}^{th}\) position on your palm and all the other decks can be placed elsewhere. As
                    we took for example that he chose \(12\), we express \(11\ =\ 1 + 5 * 2\) and that’s why the pile he
                    pointed first time was put at the second position from the top (numbered \(1\) in \(base \ 5\) as per our
                    notation).</li>
                    <li>Flip the cards (side A faces down in your palm), and distribute them again in \(5\) piles as was
                        done above and again ask Ram to tell the pile that contains his card. Again pick up the cards
                        pile wise (side A faces up), and now place the pile with the required card at the \({b}^{th}\) position on
                        your palm. That’s why the pile pointed by ram for the second time was put at the \({3}^{rd}\) position
                        from the top (numbered \(2\) in \(base\ 5\) as per our notation). Put the gathered deck of those \(25\)
                        cards (side A facing up) in your palm. Count out the cards from the top, and here it is \({k}^{th}\) card
                        turned over is the very same card that Ram selected.</li>
        </ol>
        Here we are with the deep mathematical insight for \(base\ 5\):<br />
        Think of the \(5\) piles of cards as the zeroth pile, the first pile, the second pile, the third pile, and
        the fourth pile, and think of the \({a}^{th}\) card in each pile where \(0 \leq a \leq 4\). Thus we count our piles and
        cards in each pile starting with \(0\) instead of \(1\) just as we did while numbering the cards in the deck
        from \(0\) to \(24\) rather than from \(1\) to \(25\). For the trick to work, we first determine where the chosen card
        appears as the \({a}^{th}\) card in the \({b}^{th}\) pile after the two dealing with \(0 \leq a\), \(b \leq 4\).
    </p>
    <p><b>Illustration:</b> Consider for \(a\ =\ 3\), the cards of the selected pile will appear as card numbered \(3\) in all the piles number \(0,\ 1,\ 2, \3\) or \(4\) and as soon as the pile of cards is pointed out the second time,
        placing the pile at any position \(b\ =\ 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3\) or(\ 4\) gives the resultant \(3,\ 8,\ 13,\ 18\) or \(23\) respectively, since
        we know that these values of \(b\) correspond to the upper resultants in the \(base\ 5\) decoded version. And
        hence a total of \(5 * b + a\) cards appear on the top of the required card giving the required card at
        \({((5 * b + a) + 1)}^{th}\) position from the top, when the cards are being rolled out (side A facing up in the
        palm) for the required number with the value of \(k\) chosen as \(4,\ 9,\ 14,\ 19\ or\ 24\).</p>
    <p>Trivially, looking for \(a\ =\ 0\), the cards of the pointed pile will appear on the \({0}^{th}\) position in all the
        \(5\) piles (facing upwards) and on pointing the pile the second time and placing it as the \({b}^{th} pile leads
        to positioning of the required card on required numbers as \(1\), \(6\), \(11\), \(16\) or \(21\) for different choices of \(b\).</p>
        
    <p>But you might be thinking what is bizarre about this trick. Let us understand why this card trick is
        so beguiling. Not only this trick deals with number asked randomly from the person, but, if you have
        a pack of \({x}^{y}\) cards in total, then you can show this trick by distributing the cards into \(x\) piles, and
        doing the distributing task \(y\) times, you can place the required card at any given position in the deck
        with the newly specified number of cards. Following the same steps: decrease one from the designated
        position number, and convert the result to \(base\ x\) as a \(y\) digit number. The ones digit of the computed
        number tells you where to place the pile containing the required card after the first deal with \(n−1\) as
        the bottom pile and \(0\) as the topmost one, and the procedure continues for the remaining \(y − 1\) deals
        as well.</p>
