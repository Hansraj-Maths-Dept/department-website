                <h1>The Law of Excluded Middle</h1>
                <h6 class="author" style="line-height: 2.0;"><b>Author: &nbsp; </b> Shivam Baurai <br /> <b>B.Sc. (H) Mathematics</b></h6>
                <hr>
                <p>This is an assessment of the much debated law of excluded middle, which has an intimate relationship
                    with mathematical reasoning. This article will attempt to describe this law, establish its role
                    in mathematics and explore the arguments against the law. An argument against the criticism will
                    be provided to maintain neutrality in this discussion; this article is not written to take any
                    particular
                    side, it is written to introduce the field of metamathematics, using fairly familiar concepts</p>
                <p>This article refers to works of formal logic and philosophy. Both fields are treated to make them
                    as irrelevant as possible for the purpose of this article, which is achieved by giving simplified,
                    and not
                    technical, explanations of concepts belonging to these fields.</p>
                <p>The references given in the article provide a detailed discussion of the concepts this article
                    introduces.
                    The references, the reader will find, pertain mostly to the fields of logic and mathematical
                    philosophy. Before beginning, it is important to introduce the ideas that are prerequisites for this
                    article.</p>
                <p>Following is a list of important symbols:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>\(p\) : a proposition. In simple terms, this is a statement. For example, “This car is red”.</li>
                    <li>\(\sim \) : This symbol denotes negation. For example, \(\sim p \) reads “This car is not red”.</li>
                    <li>\(\circ \) : This symbol denotes the logical conjunction “and”. The usage is similar to the use of the
                        symbol \(\cap \) in set theory. For example, given <b>p</b>: “x is an even number” and <b>q</b>: “x is a prime
                        number”, then \(p \circ q\) : “x is an even number that is prime” or “\(x = 2\) ”.</li>
                    <li>\(\vee \) : This symbol denotes the logical disjunction “or”. The usage is similar to the use of the
                        symbol \(\cup \) in set theory. For example, given <b>p</b>: “x is a positive real number” and <b>q</b>: “x is a negative
                        real number”, one deduces that \(p \vee q \): “\(x \neq 0\)”.</li>
                    <li>\(\Rightarrow \): This symbol denotes implication. \(p \Rightarrow q \) means that whenever <b>p</b> is true, <b>q</b> is true and
                        whenever <b>p</b> is false, so is <b>q</b>.</li>
                </ul>
                Now, we shall state a few important laws/principles/terms:
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Principle of reductio ad absurdum</b>: A form of argument, where a proposition is disproven
                        following its implication of the absurd. Symbolically put, the argument follows: Assume <b>p</b> is
                        true, \(p \Rightarrow q\) , and \( p \Rightarrow (q \circ \sim q) \). This means that \( p \Rightarrow (q \circ \sim q) \), which cannot hold true (the proof
                        of this will follow later in the article). For convenience, we shall call this <b>RAA</b>.</li>
                    <li><b>Tautology</b>: An assertion that is true for every possible interpretation. For example, <b>p</b>: “The
                        ball is green, or it is not green” is true whatever the colour of the ball.</li>
                    <li><b>De Morgan’s Law</b>: \(\sim (p \circ q) \Leftrightarrow \sim p \vee \sim q\).</li>
                    <li><b>Principle of vicious-circle</b>: “Whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the
                        collection”. This principle is posited as an axiom.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now, we can define the law of excluded middle (<b>LEM</b>), which we introduce as an axiom.</p>
                <p class="cen">Given a proposition, either it is true or its negation is.</p>
                <p>Symbolically,\[p \vee \sim p\]</p>
                <p>We now introduce the law of non-contradiction as a theorem:</p>
                <br /><br />
                <p><b>Theorem</b> (Law of non-contradiction - LNC). A proposition cannot be both true and false at the same
                    time. <em>Symbolically</em>, \(\sim (p \circ \sim p)\)</p>
                <p>Proof. Note that \(p \vee \sim p\) (LEM).</p>
                <p>Then, by De Morgan’s law \(p \vee \sim p \Rightarrow \sim (p \circ \sim q)\).</p>
                <p>It has been shown that <b>LNC</b> is deducible from <b>LEM</b>. Further, we can now present a basic definition
                    of <b>LEM</b>: <em>Given a proposition, either it is true or false</em>.
                    Note that <b>RAA</b> is due to <b>LNC</b>. In the definition of <b>RAA</b>, it was remarked that \(p \circ \sim p \) is absurd.
                    As per <b>LNC</b>, it has been established that this assertion is false, and therefore absurd.
                    Recall the technique of proof by contradiction. The technique is a direct application of <b>RAA</b> and
                    <b>LEM</b>. Since it has been shown that <b>LEM</b> is responsible for <b>RAA</b>, we conclude that proof by
                    contradiction is also due to <b>LEM</b>. Any question on the validity of <b>LEM</b>, therefore, has huge consequences for
                    mathematics. Not only is the technique of proof by contradiction under the scanner, but a
                    considerable
                    part of mathematical reasoning needs to be revisited.</p>
                <h3>Validity of the Law of Excluded Middle</h3>
                <p>Consider the following proposition (<b>Liar’s Paradox</b>):</p>
                <p class="cen"><i>I am lying</i></p>
                <p>Let us consider the two possibilities permitted by <b>LEM</b>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The proposition is true - This means I am lying, which implies that I am not lying. Therefore,
                        the proposition is false, which cannot happen (<b>LNC</b>).</li>
                    <li>The proposition is false - This means I am not lying, which implies that I am lying. Therefore,
                        the proposition is true. Again, this cannot happen.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Here, <b>LEM</b> fails to hold. However, this paradox is not without a solution. Before proceeding further,
                    it should clearly be recorded that <b>LEM</b> is a tautology. (Notice that <b>LEM</b> clearly holds sometimes;
                    for example, <b>p</b>: “<i>x</i> is a positive real number”).</p>
                <p>First of all, it should be remarked that natural language is far too incoherent and ambiguous to be
                    formalized. Therefore, the solution must begin with the translation of this statement into the
                    symbolic
                    language of logic. Such an interpretation goes like this:</p>
                <p class="cen"><i>e is a proposition p, that if I affirm it, it is false</i></p>
                <p>Now, we call our interpretation <b>q</b>. Note that <b>q</b> refers to all propositions <b>p</b>, since we claim that <b>LEM</b>
                    is a tautology. The paradox arises because of self-reference; since <b>q</b> is defined for all 
                    propositions <b>p</b>, it must also be defined for <b>q</b>. This, as already seen, leads to contradiction of <b>LEM</b>. Here, the
                    principle of
                    vicious-circle must be referred. This principle prohibits <b>q</b> to refer to itself, and therefore, the
                    paradox
                    is blocked.</p>
                <p>The principle is due to Bertrand Russell. He argued that all logical paradoxes arise because of the
                    violation of this principle. To return to familiarity, it is useful to consider Russell’s Paradox,
                    which
                    can be approached along similar lines. The paradox is as follows: Define \(R := {x|x \in x}\) Then,</p>
                <p class="cen">\[R \in R \Leftrightarrow R \notin R \].</p>
                <p>The principle of vicious circle solves the Russell’s paradox. However, it is important here to give a
                    slightly more academic treatment of this principle - that is, Russell’s <b>Theory of types</b>.</p>
                <p>Russell assigned types to sets. For example, sets of type I would be elements in a set of type II,
                    and no element of type II or higher can be contained in a set of type II. Similarly, we can treat
                    sets
                    of type III, IV and so on, creating a hierarchy of sets. The hierarchy develops as follows:
                    individuals
                    are placed at the lowest level (for example, natural numbers), followed by a class of individuals
                    (for
                    example, a set of natural numbers), and then a class further up (For example, the set of sets of
                    natural
                    numbers), and so on.</p>
                <p>It is now easy to see that the question whether <i>R</i> is contained in itself is trivially solved. A
                    similar
                    treatment of the Liar’s paradox is possible. If <b>p</b> is a proposition of type n, then <b>q</b> becomes a
                    proposition
                    of type n + 1, and therefore, the paradox is solved.</p>
                <p>Set theory in particular deals with paradoxes of this kind by introducing strict axioms (ZFC Set
                    Theory), which blocks the construction of sets that contain themselves. Since the approach of
                    Russell’s
                    solution is similar to this one (both introduce axioms to block self-reference), and since neither
                    suggests
                    against <b>LEM</b>, a detailed discussion on axiomatic set theory is omitted.</p>
                <p>Returning to Liar’s paradox, Russell’s solution is not without criticism. The works of Tarski,
                    Kripke,
                    and Barwise and Etchemendy deal with these criticisms and provide arguably stronger solutions. They
                    are, however, a break from the mathematics-centric perspective that this article attempts to take.
                    It is
                    important here to comment that the contradiction of <b>LEM</b> is far from being merely an abstract idea.
                    Indeed, we have applications where there are more than two truth values (true and false). There is
                    one example of the included middle in quantum mechanics - the famous thought experiment by Erwin
                    Schrödinger (Schrödinger’s cat), which argues that if a cat is sealed in a box with a radioactive
                    item,
                    one would not know whether the cat is dead or alive until the box is opened. In simple terms, the
                    cat,
                    in a sense, is both dead and alive until the box is opened. Further, it is possible to develop
                    systems
                    of logic where, given a proposition, it can have more than two truth values: finite-valued logic,
                    which
                    allows n truth values (applications are found in the field of Electronics Design, and study of
                    stable
                    states of circuits and integrated circuits), and infinite-valued logic, which allows infinitely many
                    truth
                    values (for example, fuzzy logic associates truth values with real numbers in the interval [0, 1],
                    and
                    finds applications in facial recognition, as well as economics, particularly in risk assessment
                    systems).</p>
                <h3>Constructivism in Mathematics</h3>
                <p><b>LEM</b> does not find unanimous support amongst mathematicians. While everyone agrees that <b>LEM</b>
                    holds when limited to finite collections, criticism arises when discussing the extension of <b>LEM</b> to
                    the infinite (although there do exist examples where <b>LEM</b> holds for infinite sets - There are either
                    finite primes or infinite; it cannot be generalized). Mathematics based on a logical system that
                    does
                    not assume <b>LEM</b> is called <b>Constructive Mathematics</b>. Constructivism is not merely mathematics
                    without proofs by contradiction; the differences are far more fundamental. For example, in
                    constructive
                    mathematics, the phrase “there exists” is replaced by “we can construct”. It does not suffice to
                    prove
                    the existence of a mathematical entity, we must also construct it. Constructive logic actually ties
                    existence with construction with the help of the existence property: Whenever we prove
                    constructively
                    that there exists a \(x \in X : P(x)\) is true, we actually find at least one \(a \in X : P(a)\); we call a the
                    witness.</p>
                <p>Supporters of constructivism argue that these proofs are superior as they give an algorithm to
                    construct such entities. A mathematical entity, constructivists say, is anything that can be
                    constructed.</p>
                <p>Classical logic (where <b>LEM</b> holds) also is not without supporters. Amongst them is David Hilbert,
                    who remarked, “Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same,
                    say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists”. Existence
                    is
                    free from contradiction, argues Hilbert. Therefore, if we can prove that an object, having
                    particular
                    properties, does not cause contradictions, then it exists, and constructing that object is not
                    required.
                    It is fascinating to note that while constructive mathematics and ‘classical’ mathematics differ at
                    the
                    foundational level, their works are remarkably similar. Foundations of <em>Constructive Analysis</em> by E.
                    Bishop develops much of 20<sup>th</sup> century analysis using the principles of constructive mathematics.</p>
                <p>It is important now to see the working of constructive mathematics, and contrast it with
                    nonconstructive
                    mathematics. The obvious place to begin is with the proof of the irrationality of \(\sqrt{2} \).</p>
                <p><b>Theorem</b>.\(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.</p>
                <p>Proof. Let \(r = \frac{a}{b}\) , where a, b are positive integers.<br />
                    If a is even, b cannot be even.<br />
                    Then, a<sup>2</sup> is doubly even (i.e. divisible by 4), while 2b<sup>2</sup> is singly even (i.e. divisible by 2, but
                    not 4).<br />
                    Therefore, 2b<sup>2</sup> and a<sup>2</sup> are distinct integers.<br />
                    If a is odd, and b is even, 2b<sup>2</sup> and a<sup>2</sup> are clearly distinct. And if a and b are both odd, we again
                    reach
                    the same conclusion.<br />
                    So, we have \(|2{b}^{2} − {a}^{2}| \geq 1 \). Dividing and multiplying by \(\sqrt{2}+ \frac{a}{b}\) , we get</p>
                <p class="cen">\[|\sqrt{2} - \frac{a}{b}| = \frac{|2{b}^{2}-{a}^{2}|}{{b}^{2}(\sqrt{2}+\frac{a}{b})} \geq \frac{1}{{b}^{2}(\sqrt{2}+\frac{a}{b})} \geq \frac{1}{3{b}^{2}}\]</p>
                <p>It has now been established that \(\sqrt{2} \) is distinct from any rational number r. Therefore, \(\sqrt{2} \) is
                    irrational.</p>
                <p>Consider the following theorem, which contrasts the mechanism of constructive and non-constructive
                    proofs.</p>
                <p><b>Theorem</b>. <em>There exist two irrational real numbers <i>a</i> and <em>b</em> such that <em>ab</em> is rational</em>.</p>
                <p><em>Proof</em>. (Non-constructive) Let a and b be irrational real numbers. Consider <em>ab</em>. It must be either
                    rational or irrational. If it is rational, we are done. Assume it is irrational. Suppose we have, \({\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}}\)
                    which we assume is irrational. Then, \({\left({\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)}^{\sqrt{2}} = {\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}} = 2\), which is rational.<br />
                    <em>Proof</em>. (Constructive) Consider the irrational numbers \(a = \sqrt{2} \), and \(b = \log_{2}9\). Then \({a}^{b} = 2(\log_{2}3) = 3\),
                    which is rational.</p>
                <p>Note that while the non-constructive proof also constructs irrational numbers a and b which satisfy
                    the theorem (\({\sqrt{2}}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is indeed irrational), the proof is not constructive in nature because it explores the
                    possibilities permitted by <b>LEM</b> and shows that one of them must satisfy the theorem, but does not
                    commit to one possibility.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>It is important to remark that the debate on the validity of <b>LEM</b> is by no means ‘solved’. However,
                    the
                    deductions that follow from it are still widely accepted in mathematics. Also, as mentioned already,
                    logical systems with more than two truth values not only exist, but also find useful applications in
                    many fields of science and technology. Further, it serves well to remind again of the introductory
                    level
                    of the knowledge provided here; there are sections, especially the one about the validity of <b>LEM</b>,
                    that can be pursued productively, for there are avenues that can be explored (for example, Russell’s
                    solution fails to hold when we strengthen the liar; “<em>The following statement is false</em>”, “<em>The
                    previous statement is true</em>”).</p>
                <p>It is a fascinating, almost amusing, fact that constructive proofs are not the new wave of
                    mathematics,
                    as it might seem from the presentation of this article. In fact, some of Hilbert’s earlier works,
                    which were non-constructive, were infamously dismissed as theology. And the initial criticism of
                    Cantor
                    is well-documented. A fantastic presentation of the history of metamathematics and logic, and its
                    protagonists can be found in <em>Logicomix: An Epic Search For Truth (2009)</em> by Apostolos Doxiadis and
                    Christos Papadimitriou.</p>
