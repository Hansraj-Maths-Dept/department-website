    <h1>Subgroups of Dihedral Groups</h1>
    <h6 class="cen">Ekansh Jauhari<br />B.Sc. (H) Mathematics, 3rd Year</h6>
    <p>A <b>dihedral group</b> is a group of symmetries of a regular polygon, with respect to function composition
        on its symmetrical rotations and reflections, and identity is the trivial rotation where the
        symmetry is unchanged. For such an \(n\)-sided polygon, the corresponding dihedral group, known as \(D_{n}\)
        has order \(2n\), and has \(n\) rotations and \(n\) reflections.</p>
    <p>Let us denote the first rotation by \(y\). Rotating the symmetry \(n\) times would again give the same
        position of the symmetry. So performing function composition \(y\), \(n\) times, we get the identity \(e\),
        therefore we can write it as \(y^{n}\ = e\). Also, let us denote the first reflection by \(x\). Reflecting the
        symmetry twice will give us symmetry with the original position. Thus, we denote \(x^{2} = e\), and
        similarly, every reflection has order 2.</p>
    <p>Dihedral groups are generated by a reflection and a rotation, such that we write dihedral group
        \(D_{n}=< y, x >\) (finitely generated). Here \(y^{n} = e\) and \(x^{2} = e\). So, we get rotations of the form of integer
        powers of \(y\). For reflections, we have them in the form of composition of \(x\) with some power of \(y\), i.e.,
        \(x{y}^{k}\), \(k\) is between 0 and \(n − 1\) (both inclusive). Thus, \[D_{n} = {e, y, y^{2}, . . . , y^{n−1}, x, xy, x{y}^{2}, . . . , x{y}^{n−1}}, and |D_{n}| = 2n,\]</p>
    <p>where \(y^{n} = e\) and \(x^{2} = e\).</p>
    <p>We can notice that the rotations in \(G = D_{n}\) form a group in itself.<br />
        So we take \(H = {e, y, y^{2}, y^{3}, . . . , y^{n−1}}\) where \(y^{n} = e\).<br />
        So \(H < G\)(\(H\) is the subgroup of \(G = D_{n}\)). Clearly, \(H =< y >\) is a cyclic group since all the elements
        of \(H\), i.e., the rotations, are some integral powers of \(y\). Thus, \(|H| = n\).</p>
    <p>If we find the index of \(H\) in \(G\), then it would be \(\frac{2n}{n} = 2\). Since \(H\) comes out to be a subgroup of
        Index-2, then we can say that any arbitrary subgroup of \(G\) will either be contained in \(H\) or will have
        exactly half of the elements as that in \(H\). If \(S < G\) is any arbitrary subgroup contained in \(H\), then
        \(S < H\), and since \(H\) is cyclic, \(S\) will also be cyclic.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, if \(S < G\) isn’t contained in \(H\), then it has exactly half rotations. Since \(S < G\), it can
        have only rotations and reflections. Since there are half rotations in \(S\), the other half are reflections
        in \(S\). Thus, \(S\) is a dihedral group.</p>
    <p class="cen"><b>Any subgroup of a dihedral group is either cyclic group or dihedral group.</b></p>
    <h3>Number of Cyclic Subgroups of a Dihedral Group</h3>
    <p>For any arbitrary \(S\ <\ G\), if \(S\) is contained in \(H\), then \(S\ <\ H\), and \(S\) is cyclic. Since \(H\ =<\ y\ >\)
        and subgroup \(S\ <<\ y\ >\), thus, \(S\) will be generated by some integer power of \(y\) where the integer
        power divides \(n\), because \(H\ =<\ y\ >\) and \(y^{n} = e\), and thus, \(S\ =<\ y^{n/d}\ >\) where \(d|n\) (\(d\) divides \(n\)), for
        \(1 \leq d \leq n\). For such \(y^{n/d}\), clearly the order is \(d\). Thus, \(y\) raised to the power of divisors of \(n\) generate
        \(S\), for all possible divisors. So, there are as many as cyclic subgroups as there are divisors of \(n\).</p>
    <h3>Number of Dihedral Subgroups in a Dihedral Group</h3>
    <p>For any arbitrary \(S < G\), if \(S\) is not contained in \(H\), then \(S\) is a dihedral group. So, \(S\) will be generated
        by a rotation and a reflection. For a reflection, we initially have \(n\) choices: \(x, xy, x{y}^{2}, . . . , x{y}^{n−1}\). For
        the rotation, since a rotation will again generate a cyclic subgroup within the new dihedral subgroup,
        and this new cyclic subgroup will certainly be a subgroup of \(H\), and as \(H\ =<\ y\ >\), therefore, the
        rotation can be of the form \(y^{n/d}\) only, where \(d|n\). Here, as mentioned above, the order of \(y^{n/d}\) is \(d\),
        and thus there are \(d\) rotations in \(S\), and being a dihedral the same number of reflections also. So, we
        conclude that: <br /> \(S\ =<\ y^{n/d},\ x{y}^{p}\ >\) for \(d|n\) and \(0 \leq p < n.\)</p>
    <p>For a given \(d|n\), when we try generating \(S\) with the resulting \(y^{n/d}\) and with all possible values of
        \(p\) between 0 and \(n − 1\), taken one by one, we find that we obtain exactly \(\frac{n}{d}\)distinct dihedral groups
        (implying that there are exactly \(\frac{n}{d}\) choices for \(p\)). This is because the dihedrals obtained when we take
        \(x{y}^{p}\) and \(x{y}^{p+i(n/d)}\), where \(i\) is some non-negative integer, are the same.</p>
    <p>The dihedrals obtained when we take \(x{y}^{p}\) and \(x{y}^{p+i(n/d)}\) are same because for some \(p\), we obtain a
        dihedral by performing the operation \(x{y}^{p} · {y}^{u(n/d)}\) for non-negative integer \(u\), thus getting \(x{y}^{p+u(n/d)}\).
        The same dihedral is obtained when we have \(x{y}^{p+i(n/d)}\), and perform operation \(x{y}^{p+i(n/d)} · {y}^{t(n/d)}\)
        for some non-negative integer \(t\), thus making the resultant as \(x{y}^{p+(i+t)(n/d)}\) where \(i + t\) is again a
        non-negative integer, which is equivalent to \(x{y}^{p+u(n/d)}\). So basically, for each \(d|n\), we have exactly
        \(\frac{n}{d}\) number of dihedral subgroups, which is equivalent to saying that for \(d\) number of rotations and \(d\)
        number of reflections, we have exactly \(\frac{n}{d}\) distinct such dihedral groups in \(D_{n}\). So, for every divisor of \(n\),
        there are that number of dihedrals present, which means that the total number of dihedral subgroups
        is the sum of all positive divisors of \(n\).</p>
    <p class="cen"><b>Number of dihedral subgroups of \(D_{n}\) = sum of all positive divisors of \(n\) in \(D_{n}\)</b></p>
    <h3>Number of Subgroups of Dn which are both Dihedral and Cyclic
        in nature</h3>
    <p>As \(1|n\), so for \(d\ =\ 1\) in the above setup, we get \(S\ =\ <\ {y}^{n},\ x{y}^{p}\ >\), or \(S\ =<\ x{y}^{p}\ >\), making \(S\) cyclic.
        As there are \(\frac{n}{1}\ =\ n\) choices for \(p\), we conclude that there are \(n\) number of cyclic dihedral subgroups.
        So interestingly, they show both natures: dihedral because they have 1 rotation and 1 reflection, and
        cyclic because their order is 2.</p>
    <p class="cen"><b>Number of subgroups of \(D_{n}\) which are both dihedral and cyclic in nature \(= n\)</b></p>
    <h3>Number of Subgroups in a Dihedral Group</h3>
    <p>Now, we aim to find the exact number of subgroups present in \({D}_{n}\) for any given order. For any
        arbitrary \(S\ <\ G\), let us have \(|S|\ =\ s\). If \(S\ <\ H\), then \(s|n\). Since there exists a unique subgroup of each
        possible order in a cyclic group, therefore, we have 1 cyclic subgroup for order \(s\) of \(S\) where \(s|n\). If \(s\)
        does not divide \(n\), then we don’t have this subgroup. On the other hand, if \(S\) isn’t contained in \(H\),
        then \(S\) is dihedral of order \(s\) with \(\frac{s}{2}\)
        rotations and \(\frac{s}{2}\)
        reflections in \(S\). If \(s\) is odd, \(\frac{s}{2}\)
        is not an integer
        and therefore \(S\) does not exist. So for \(s\) being odd, we have no dihedral subgroups in \(D_{n}\).</p>
    <p>If \(s\) is even, then it is possible to have \(\frac{s}{2}\)
        rotations and reflections. From previous argument, we
        had that for \(d\) number of rotations and \(d\) number of reflections, there were exactly \(\frac{n}{d}\) distinct dihedral
        subgroups, and thus in analogy with this result, we get \(\frac{n}{s/2}\) distinct dihedral subgroups, i.e., \(\frac{2n}{s}\) dihedral
        subgroups.</p>
    <p>So if \(s|n\), we have a cyclic subgroup. If \(s\) doesn’t divide \(n\), then no such cyclic subgroup is present.
        Also, if \(n\) is even, we have \(\frac{2n}{s}\) dihedral subgroups, but for \(n\) being odd, we don’t have any dihedral
        subgroup in \(D_{n}\).</p>
    <p><b>For any \(S\ <\ G\) where \(|S|\ =\ s\), we have following four cases:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>If \(s|n\) and \(s\) is even, we have \(1 + \frac{2n}{s}\) subgroups of order \(s\) in \({D}_{n}\).</b></li>
        <li><b>If \(s|n\) and \(s\) is odd, we have only one subgroup of order \(s\) in \({D}_{n}\),</b></li>
        <li><b>If \(s\) doesn’t divide \(n\), and \(s\) is even, we have \(\frac{2n}{s}\) subgroups of order \(s\) in \({D}_{n}\).</b></li>
        <li><b>If \(s\) doesn’t divide \(n\), and \(s\) is odd, then there doesn’t exist any subgroup of order \(s\) in \({D}_{n}\).</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Example</em>: In case of \(D_{6}\), possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Total there are 4 cyclic and 12 dihedral
        subgroups.</p>
    <p>For \(s = 1\), there is only 1 subgroup (The trivial Identity group).<br />
        For \(s = 2\), there are 7 subgroups.<br />
        For \(s = 3\), there is only 1 subgroup.<br />
        For \(s = 4\), there are 3 subgroups.<br />
        For \(s = 6\), there are 3 subgroups.<br />
        For \(s = 12\), there is only 1 subgroup (The Group itself).</p>
