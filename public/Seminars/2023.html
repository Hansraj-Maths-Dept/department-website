        <p class="seminar-content">With the onset of every semester and as the time elapse the question which
            increases the tension amongst students is, “What after maths?”, if you know
            the answer to this then you may get struck by another question, “How to move
            forward and accomplish our goal?”, but that’s not all what the students face
            some people know everyting about their goals but couldn’t focus much, for the
            betterment of the students and to give them a clear idea about their future goals,
            plenty of seminars are being conducted by the department.</p>

            <h2 id="coms">Anant</h2>
            <p class="content-1">The Department organized a session on paper writing, 'Anant: A Research pathway to students'.The session was conducted by a professor of our very department, Prof Preeti Dharmarha. The primary aim of organizing this seminar was to familiarize the students with writing effective research papers. The session aimed towards guiding the young minds into aligning their thoughts and writing them down in a way that makes it not only interesting but also bona fide and reasonable. The discussion shed light upon the importance of research in daily life.

                Ma'am divided the entire session into a few questions making it easier for the audience to keep up. She kept interacting with the students solving their queries one by one. She stated the necessity of assumptions, counterexamples, generalization and applications in a research paper. She also briefed us about the ill-effects plagiarism and how to avoid it while writing a paper. 
                
                The faculty members of the department also participated during the seminar and their graceful presence made the seminar even more insightful. Overall the session was very interactive and well recieved by the attendants.

            <h2 id="gmm">Lakshay</h2>
            <p class="content-1">The Department of Mathematics on the 1st of March, 2023 organised a very exuberant and unexpectedly interactive speaker session on 'Career Choices after Graduating in Sciences'. The speciality of the session was that the Chief Guests were alumnus students of the department itself who have grown up to be extremely successful people in life and are at a very respectable position in their respective fields of work and hence had come in to motivate the current batches for the same. The session was conducted in the New Seminar Room and as scheduled, began at 1 in the afternoon. 

                The session started off with the traditional lamp lighting ceremony followed by welcoming of the speakers with a plant each as a token of love from the department. The plants were presented to them by the professors of the department, something that was highlighted by the speakers as a very regular ritual even in their days when they arranged such seminars and handed over the flower pots to the same teachers they were receiving them from that day. The Circle of Life. Up next came our guest members on the stage and spoke about their life experiences post graduating from this very college. The kind of things they said they did made everyone in that room connect to them in some way or the other because somehow it all felt very personal. Not only did the session prove to be very informative and useful but also took the speakers along with our professors down the memory lane. 
                
                More than a session on career counselling it felt like a room of people who have known each other for long and were just having a healthy discussion on how to look at the future opportunities. The Council students then took a group photo with the speakers, their department alumni too, and called it a day

            <h2 id="gm">Pi-Logue</h2>
            <p class="content-1">            
                The International Pi-Day, celebrated around the world on the 14th of March, is a very interesting event to observe. For some, π is just a constant. For others it's only a fraction and for many more, it is irrelevant. But for those who know what value π actually holds, know that this never ending number is just the beginning of the absurdity that exists in nature. And that it is the only pathway to travel through that infinity road, understanding what it takes to make sense out of nothing.

                So the Department of Mathematics conducts 'Pi-Logue', an annual event organised in celebration of the significance of the magnanimous value of Pi. Following the traditions, this year too, Pi-Logue consisted of a speaker session and a couple of exciting competitions.

                The event kickstarted with a challenging competition where Math-enthusiasts had to recite 50 digits of Pi after the decimal in minimum time. Another category was to recite maximum digits of Pi as they can memorise.

                The worthy winner of first category was Kajal from Daulat Ram College who broke the previous record and recited the 50 digits of Pi in just 6.01 seconds. And the potential winner of second category was Simran Singh, third year from Hansraj College, she did a spectacular job of reciting 350 digits of Pi.

                After a short break, everyone reconvened for the second half of the event.To commemorate the contribution of Bharti Krishna Ji - Creator of Vedic Ganit. The event was followed with a talk by Anil Kumar Thakur and Dr. Prempal Singh, both currently serving as co-ordinators of Vedic Ganit Delhi, SSUN. 

                Anil Kumar Thakur initiated the talk and laid a discussion on various sutras of Vedic ganit. Dr Prempal Singh continued the talk and specified the contribution of Swami Bharti Krishna Tirth ji, the creator of Vedic Mathematics in various fields of Mathematics.This was followed by an interactive question - answer round. 

                Then Prof. Raksha Verma, a professor of the department itself, paid the vote of thanks to both the speakers and to all the attendees of the session. She presented a beautiful poem in honour of Krishna Tirth ji. Then came the most awaited prize distribution ceremony wherein the winners of the Pi-Logue competition were presented with theirs winning hampers and certificates.

                To sum it up, the day was like a good ride on a bright sunny day and everyone took a special memory back home.
