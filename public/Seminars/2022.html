            increases the tension amongst students is, “What after maths?”, if you know
            the answer to this then you may get struck by another question, “How to move
            forward and accomplish our goal?”, but that’s not all what the students face
            some people know everyting about their goals but couldn’t focus much, for the
            betterment of the students and to give them a clear idea about their future goals,
            plenty of seminars are being conducted by the department.</p>

            <h2 id="coms">Career Opportunities in Indian Army</h2>
            <p class="content-1">The Department of Mathematics, Hansraj College, successfully conducted the third episode of "Lakshya: The Career Talks" with Captain (Dr.) Sunaina Singh on 6th February 2022. She is an ex-army officer, ex-University of Delhi professor, motivational speaker, and national-level handball player with a doctorate in psychology and MBA in HR. It was an interactive session where Sunaina ma'am cleared the doubts of our audience on the topic with really comprehensive and detailed answers.
                The session commenced with diving into Dr. Sunaina's personal life experiences and she told us what initially motivated her was the ideology of living for others and quoted, "Apne liye toh sabhi jeete hain, insaan wahi hai jo desh ke liye kuch kare, dusron ke liye kuch kare". She also explained how success can have distinct significance for everyone and it is a journey to be celebrated.  Further, our audience asked various questions concerning joining the army, such as the perfect time to join the army, and the different channels through which one can join it. While answering those questions, ma'am provided a deep insight into how the interviews are conducted, giving students an in-depth understanding of how the psychological aspects are reflected in the interview, which is unknown to most of the candidates applying for the same.
                Her ultimate message to the students was to always believe in themselves, be real, and be a keen learner. Lastly, she told everyone to realize that “Log different hote hai, sahi ya galat nahi” and things will become easier for them.
                The energy of the whole session was unmatched by the participation and enthusiasm displayed by the audience in the session. Overall, it was a brainstorming and inspiring session.

            <h2 id="gmm">Actuarial science as a career</h2>
            <p class="content-1">We, at the Department of Mathematics, Hansraj College, are eager to announce the successful addition of another voice in the line of speakers of our very own Lakshya series. The series consists of Career Advice sessions and the most recent one was held on 31st October, 2022. Our guest speaker this time was none other than the Founder of Actuators Educational Institute, Mr. Praveen Patwari. Along with him came Ms. Shivangi, an associate of the institute to assist Sir in his presentation. We were also surrounded with professors from the department and students of various colleges.

                The session began with the inaugural 'Diya Lighting ' ceremony, followed by a warm welcome of our guests and the College Bursar, Preeti Dharmarha Ma'am. We then leaped directly into our topic of the day - Actuarial Science as a Career. The next two hours were a detailed analysis of what Actuarial Science is and the potential it holds as a career defining subject. From institutes that offer the course at hand to the ideal timing for one to start pursuing the course, everything was covered in the session. Momentous questions from the audience and spirited replies from the speaker really kept the forum run smoothly and made it exceptionally interactive and engaging. We then called upon Sir Rakesh Batra, the convenor of the Mathematics Department to present the Letter of Appreciation to the speaker. The session finally came to an end with a note of gratitude from our Department President, Ms. Khushi Agarwal and we called it a day.

                ~A. De Morgan 
                
                Greetings everyone 🌻✨
                
                We, at the Department of Mathematics, Hansraj College, have successfully conducted our session on Vedic Maths. As declared earlier, the session was the first segment from our very own Mahatma Hansraj Memorial Lecture Series and it was a sell-out. The room was filled with dignitaries and students from and around the University Circuit and the college Principal, Prof. (Dr.) Rama herself joined us for the session. 
                
                The day began with the inaugural ceremony of lighting the 'diya', followed by the welcoming of our guest speaker - Mr. Anil Kumar, Regional Coordinator at Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas and a prodigy in Vedic Mathematics. Then, before the main event, the very students of our own Department were startled by the news of Council announcement that was kept hidden from everyone until that moment! What followed next were 10 radiant minutes of guessing, hooting, cheering and clapping for the newly formed Council! (HOORAY!)
                
                After this little off the track but really important and none the less amazing announcement, we dived in right into the world of Mathematics and mental calculations. Beginning right from the history of mathematical developments during the Vedic times to the prevalence of the methods and formula devised back then in today's world, Anil Sir's words and way of teaching hypnotized almost everyone in that room for 2 hours straight. By the end of it, the attendees were intrigued and enlighted and some were even confused! How could a concept that is this vast and salient stay so silent and unheard of for ages now! The audience had a lot of questions, all of which were very enthusiastically answered by the speaker. The day was finally wrapped up with a Thank You speech by Sir Rakesh Batra and we called it a day

            <p class="content-1">Shri Shanti Narayan Mathematics Conclave, the annual academic meet of the department was conducted as a two day event, starting on April 11, 2022 with a speaker session on Cyber Security by Prof. Anurag Jain from the Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. It was succeeded by a paper presentation competition and a Mathematical Quiz on the same day. The day ended with an interview with none other than the ‘Ramanujan Prize Awardee 2021’, Dr. Neena Gupta. On April 12, the second day, we had Prof. Ajay Kumar, a senior scientist in the University of Delhi as our guest speaker to conduct a lecture on ‘Continuity & Uniform Continuity’ and the final round of the Mathematical Quiz from the previous day. The event saw curious mathematical minds from all over the University participating with great enthusiasm.

            <h2 id="pl">Pi-Logue</h2>
            <p class="content-1">            
                The Mathematics fraternity observes March 14 as Pi Day each year. On March 14, 2022, Pi: The Department of Mathematics, Hansraj College conducted its first successful offline event, Pi-Logue, after two whole years. Following the tradition, this year, too, Pi-Logue consisted of a speaker session and a couple of exciting competitions. 
                The event kickstarted with a talk by the honourable Dr. Ranjana Jain who graced us with her esteemed presence. She holds the position of Associate Professor at the Department of Mathematics, University of Delhi. Being a vibrant soul, she left a significant impact on the entire turnout. Everyone who had the pleasure of meeting her has praised her hard-working nature, which is evident from her academic work; operator spaces, operator algebra, and Banach spaces, to name a few. At the podium, she spoke about the Perron-Frobenius Theorem, and its applications, among which were Google’s PageRank system, the Leslie Model for population dynamics, applications in PDE as well as stability of dynamical systems. This was followed by an extremely interactive question-answer round. 

                After a short break, everyone reconvened for the second half of the event, which tested how well versed the students were with Pi. Here, the participants could compete with each other in 2 ways:
                1.	Reciting the first 50 digits of Pi in minimum time.
                2.	Reciting maximum digits of Pi.

                The room was in an absolute frenzy where everyone was intently listening to the participants and cheering them on and to our delight, we found it hard to declare the winners because everyone put their best foot forward. But, as every competition demands, only a few made the cut. The first competition was won by Pragya Tiwari who recited the first 50 digits of Pi in 6.80 seconds and Simran Singh won the second competition by reciting 421 digits of Pi, which was the highest anyone could reach that day. Both were second-year students at Hansraj College.

                Overall, the day was a fun-filled one and everyone took back home a special memory.
